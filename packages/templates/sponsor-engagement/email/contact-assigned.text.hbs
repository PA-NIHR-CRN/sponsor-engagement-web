# NIHR RDN has invited you to assess the progress of your studies

Hello,

You have been nominated as a contact for {{organisationName}} studies on the NIHR Research Delivery Network's (RDN) research portfolio.

The NIHR RDN supports Sponsors and their delegates to deliver high-quality research, for the benefit of patients, the public and health and care organisations across England.

The NIHR RDN tracks the progress of research studies in its portfolio using data provided by Sponsors or their delegates on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).

The DHSC have published the Terms and Conditions for NIHR RDN support which outlines the requirements for Sponsors to provide up-to-date study data and assessments of progress to the RDN. ({{termsAndConditionsLink}})

The Sponsor Engagement Tool has been designed to support Sponsors and their delegates to meet the requirements outlined in the T&Cs. Sponsors and their delegates should use the Sponsor Engagement Tool to review the data the RDN holds on your organisations portfolio of studies and to provide study data updates and assessments to ensure the data held by the RDN is complete and up-to-date.

Please sign in to the Sponsor Engagement Tool to provide updates on studies. ({{signInLink}})

# Why am I being asked to assess studies?

Sponsors or their delegates are asked to review and assess the progress of studies when:

- A study falls behind the agreed milestones
- A study is not recruiting to target
- And the last progress assessment is over three months old

Sponsors or their delegates can request NIHR RDN support with their research study at any time. ({{requestSupportLink}})

Please note that providing regular study assessments is a requirement of the Terms and Conditions for NIHR RDN support.
Failure to do so may result in removal from the NIHR RDN Portfolio. ({{termsAndConditionsLink}})

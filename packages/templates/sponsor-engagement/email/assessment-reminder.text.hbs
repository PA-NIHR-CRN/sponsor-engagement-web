Hello,

You are a nominated contact for {{organisationNames}} for studies on the NIHR Research Delivery Network’s (RDN) research portfolio. One
or more studies require an update. Please sign in to the Sponsor Engagement Tool to provide these updates.

As a nominated contact for your organisation, you will see all studies linked to your organisation. The Sponsor Engagement Tool
does not associate contacts to specific studies or groups of studies, only to the organisation.

# Why am I being asked to assess studies?

The NIHR RDN [{{rdnLink}}] supports Sponsors and their delegates to deliver high-quality research, for the benefit of
patients, the public and health and care organisations across England.

The NIHR RDN tracks the progress of research studies in its portfolio using data provided by Sponsors or their delegates
on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).

The DHSC have published the Terms and Conditions for NIHR RDN support [{{termsAndConditionsLink}}], which outlines 
the requirements for Sponsors to provide up-to-date study data and assessments of progress to the RDN. 

The Sponsor Engagement Tool has been designed to support Sponsors and their delegates to meet the requirements outlined in 
the T&Cs. Sponsors and their delegates should use the Sponsor Engagement Tool to review the data the RDN holds on their organisation’s portfolio of studies, 
and to provide study data updates and assessments to ensure the data held by the RDN is complete and up-to-date.

Sponsors or their delegates are prompted to review and assess the progress of studies when:

- A study falls behind a planned milestone or
- A study appears to not be recruiting to target
- And the last study assessment is over three months old

Sponsors or their delegates can request NIHR RDN support with study delivery and performance at any time. [{{requestSupportLink}}]

Please note that providing regular study updates and assessments are requirements of the Terms and Conditions for NIHR RDN support
[{{termsAndConditionsLink}}]. Failure to do so may result in removal from the NIHR RDN Portfolio.

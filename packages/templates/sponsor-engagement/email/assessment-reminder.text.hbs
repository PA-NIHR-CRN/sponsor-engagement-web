Sign-in [{{signInLink}}]

Hello,

You are nominated as a Sponsor contact for studies on the NIHR Research Delivery Network’s (RDN) research portfolio. One
or more studies require an update on their status. Please sign in to the Sponsor Engagement Tool to provide these
updates.

As a nominated contact for your organisation, you will see all studies linked to your organisation. The Sponsor Engagement Tool
does not associate contacts to specific studies or groups of studies, only to the organisation.

# Why am I being asked to assess studies?

The NIHR RDN [{{rdnLink}}] supports Sponsors and their delegates to deliver high-quality research, for the benefit of
patients, the public and health and care organisations across England.


The NIHR RDN tracks the progress of research studies in its portfolio using data provided by Sponsors or their delegates
on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care.

Sponsors or their delegates are asked to review and assess the progress of studies when:

- A study falls behind the agreed milestones
- A study is not recruiting to target
- And the last progress assessment is over three months old

Sponsors or their delegates can request NIHR RDN support with their research study at any time. [{{requestSupportLink}}]

Please note that providing regular study assessments is a requirement of the Terms and Conditions for NIHR RDN support
[{{termsAndConditionsLink}}]. Failure to do so may result in removal from the NIHR RDN Portfolio.

# Nominate someone else to assess research studies

The NIHR RDN can give other people in your organisation access to this service. Contact supportmystudy@nihr.ac.uk to add

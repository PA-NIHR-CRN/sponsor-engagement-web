Hello,

You are nominated as a Sponsor contact for studies on the NIHR Clinical Research Network’s (CRN) research portfolio. One
or more studies require an update on their status. Please sign in to the Sponsor Engagement Tool to provide these
updates.

# Why am I being asked to assess studies?

The NIHR CRN [{{crnLink}}] supports Sponsors and their delegates to deliver high-quality research, for the benefit of
patients, the public and health and care organisations across England.


The NIHR CRN tracks the progress of research studies in its portfolio using data provided by Sponsors or their delegates
on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care.

Sponsors or their delegates are asked to review and assess the progress of studies when:

- A study falls behind the agreed milestones
- A study is not recruiting to target
- And the last progress assessment is over three months old

Sponsors or their delegates can request NIHR CRN support with their research study at any time. [{{requestSupportLink}}]

Please note that providing regular study assessments is a requirement of the Terms and Conditions for NIHR CRN support
[{{termsAndConditionsLink}}]. Failure to do so may result in removal from the NIHR CRN Portfolio.

# Nominate someone else to assess research studies

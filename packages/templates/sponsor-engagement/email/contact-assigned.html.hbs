      <h1>NIHR RDN has invited you to assess the progress of your studies</h1>

      <p>Hello,</p>

      <p>
        You have been nominated as a contact for
        {{organisationName}}
        on the NIHR Research Delivery Network’s (RDN) research portfolio.
      </p>

      <p>
        The
        <a href='{{rdnLink}}'>NIHR RDN</a>
        supports Sponsors and their delegates to deliver high-quality research, for the benefit of patients, the public
        and health and care organisations across England.
      </p>

      <p>
        The NIHR RDN tracks the progress of research studies in its portfolio using data provided by Sponsors or their
        delegates on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).
      </p>

      <p>
        The DHSC have published the <a href='{{termsAndConditionsLink}}'>Terms and Conditions for NIHR RDN support</a>, which outlines the requirements for Sponsors to provide up-to-date study data and assessments of progress to the RDN.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Sponsor Engagement Tool has been designed to support Sponsors and their delegates to meet the requirements
        outlined in the T&Cs. Sponsors and their delegates should use the Sponsor Engagement Tool to review the data the
        RDN holds on their organisations portfolio of studies and to provide study data updates and assessments to ensure
        the data held by the RDN is complete and up-to-date.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please sign in to the Sponsor Engagement Tool to provide updates on studies.

      <h2>Why am I being asked to assess studies?</h2>

      <p>Sponsors or their delegates are asked to review and assess the progress of studies when:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A study falls behind a planned milestone or</li>
        <li> A study appears to not be recruiting to target</li>
        <li> And the last study assessment is over three months old</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Sponsors or their delegates can request
        <a href='{{requestSupportLink}}'>NIHR RDN support</a>
        with study delivery and performance at any time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Please note that providing regular study data updates and assessments are requirements of the
          <a href='{{termsAndConditionsLink}}'>Terms and Conditions for NIHR RDN support</a>. Failure to do so may
          result in removal from the NIHR RDN Portfolio.
        </strong>

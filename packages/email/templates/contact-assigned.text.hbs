# NIHR CRN has invited you to review and assess research studies

Hello,

The NIHR Clinical Research Network (CRN) supports patients, the public and health and care organisations across the UK
to participate in high-quality research.

The NIHR CRN tracks progress of research studies in its portfolio using data provided by study teams, and flags
studies that may require support. NIHR asks sponsors or their delegates to review these studies and confirm
whether support is required.

You have been nominated as a contact for {{organisationName}}. Sign in requires an NIHR Identity Gateway account.

# Why am I being asked to assess studies?

Sponsors or their delegates are asked to review and assess progress of studies for UK sites when:

- A study falls behind the agreed milestones in the UK
- A study study is not recruiting to target in the UK
- And the last progress assessment is over 3 months old

Sponsors or their delegates can get NIHR CRN support with their research study at any time. ({{requestSupportLink}})

# Nominate someone else to assess research studies

The NIHR CRN can give other people in your organisation access to this service. Contact crncc.support@nihr.ac.uk to add
